## Attack is the best defense
A readme on an optional project on Security and Network sniffing given by ALX.
### Concepts
*For this project, we are expected to look at these concepts:*
- [Network basics](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/33)
- [Docker](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/65)

#### 1.Dictionary attack
Password-based authentication systems can be easily broken by using a dictionary attack (weâ€™ll have to find our own password dictionary).
Let's try it on an SSH account.
- Install Docker on your machine ubuntu
- Pull and run the Docker image `sylvainkalache/264-1` with the command `docker run -p 2222:22 -d -ti sylvainkalache/264-1`
- Find a password dictionary (you might need multiple of them)
- nstall and use `hydra` to try to brute force the account `sylvain` via SSH on the Docker container
- Because the Docker container is running locally, `hydra` should access the SSH account via IP `127.0.0.1` and port `2222`
- Hint: the password is 11 characters long
